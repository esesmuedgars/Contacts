## Structural design pattern

Decided to use Model-View-ViewModel-Coordinator structural design pattern due to familiarity and ease of use. The separation of responsibilities helps avoid unmanageably large files and helps with maintainability. Dependency injection used for testability.

- **Flow Coordinator** - Responsible for navigation. Vends and present _view cotrollers_ with their _view models_.
- **View Controller** - Owns _view model_ and uses it to configure _views_, acts on _view model_ delegate methods. _View controller_ also owns _views_ and observes user interactions with user interface. Binding between _view model_ and _view_.
- **View Model** - The core of application, contains all business logic, it is crucial to test _view model_ implementation. Dependencies, such as services, are injected into _view model_ and are mocked in test cases. _View model_ owns _model_, uses services to fetch _models_, manipulates data.
- **View** - Uses _view model_ to display data. Uses delegate methods and actions to forward user interactions to _view controller_.
- **Model** - Data objects, usually parsed from services. Contain information that is accessible to _view model_.
